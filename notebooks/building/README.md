# Building Custom Components

This folder contains guides for building custom components and complete simulations.

## Contents

- **[Building Simulations](building_simulation.ipynb)** - Learn how to build complete simulations from scratch
- **[Building Controllers](building_controller.ipynb)** - Learn how to build custom control algorithms
- **[Building Custom Sensors](building_custom_sensors.ipynb)** - Learn how to build custom sensors (Camera, Radar, etc.)
- **[Building Custom Planners](building_custom_planners.ipynb)** - Learn how to build custom planning algorithms (A*, RRT, etc.)

## Learning Path

1. Start with **Building Simulations** to understand the complete architecture
2. Then explore **Building Controllers** for control algorithms
3. Learn **Building Custom Sensors** to add new perception capabilities
4. Learn **Building Custom Planners** for basic path planning
5. Explore **Advanced Planning Algorithms** for complex environments

These guides show you how to extend the SDK with your own components.

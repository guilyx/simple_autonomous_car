### 📡 [Sensors](sensors/)
- **[Building a Custom Sensor](sensors/learning_build_sensor.ipynb)** - Learn to build a custom sensor type

### 🎮 [Control](control/)
- **[Building a Custom Controller](control/learning_build_controller.ipynb)** - Learn to build a custom control algorithm

### 🗺️ [Planning](planning/)
- **[Building a Custom Planner](planning/learning_build_planner.ipynb)** - Learn to build a custom path planning algorithm

### 🗺️ [Costmaps](costmaps/)
- **[Building a Custom Costmap](costmaps/learning_build_costmap.ipynb)** - Learn to build a custom costmap implementation

### 🔬 [Algorithms](algorithms/)
- **[Advanced Planning Algorithms](algorithms/advanced_planning_algorithms.ipynb)** - Implement A* and RRT planners
- **[Control Algorithms](algorithms/control_algorithms.ipynb)** - Implement P, PID, and MPC controllers
- **[Sensor Algorithms](algorithms/sensor_algorithms.ipynb)** - Implement filtering, clustering, and fusion

## 🎯 Learning Path

### Beginner
1. **Start here**: [Understanding Classes and OOP](oop_fundamentals/understanding_classes_and_oop.ipynb) - Learn the fundamentals
2. **Then try**: [Building a Custom Sensor](sensors/learning_build_sensor.ipynb) - Simplest component

### Intermediate
3. [Building a Custom Costmap](costmaps/learning_build_costmap.ipynb) - Process sensor data
4. [Building a Custom Controller](control/learning_build_controller.ipynb) - Control the car
5. [Control Algorithms](algorithms/control_algorithms.ipynb) - Learn different control approaches

### Advanced
6. [Building a Custom Planner](planning/learning_build_planner.ipynb) - Generate paths
7. [Advanced Planning Algorithms](algorithms/advanced_planning_algorithms.ipynb) - Implement complex algorithms
8. [Sensor Algorithms](algorithms/sensor_algorithms.ipynb) - Advanced sensor processing

## 📖 What Are These Notebooks?

### Fill-in-the-Blank Notebooks
Most notebooks in this folder are **incomplete, fill-in-the-blank notebooks** designed for hands-on learning. You'll need to:
1. **Read the comments and instructions** carefully
2. **Understand the concepts** explained in each section
3. **Fill in the missing code** based on the guidance provided
4. **Test your implementation** to verify it works

### Complete Tutorial Notebooks
Some notebooks (like the OOP fundamentals) are **complete tutorials** that explain concepts with working examples.

## 💡 How to Use These Notebooks

1. **Start with the basics**: Make sure you understand the SDK fundamentals from the [tutorials](../tutorials/) folder
2. **Read carefully**: Each notebook has detailed explanations and hints
3. **Fill in the gaps**: Look for `# TODO:` comments and `...` placeholders
4. **Test incrementally**: Run cells as you complete them to catch errors early
5. **Compare with solutions**: After completing, you can check the [building](../building/) folder for complete examples

## 🎓 Tips for Success

- **Don't skip the reading**: The markdown cells contain important concepts
- **Use the hints**: Each TODO has guidance on what to implement
- **Test frequently**: Don't wait until the end to test your code
- **Ask questions**: If stuck, review the [tutorials](../tutorials/) or [building](../building/) examples
- **Experiment**: Try modifying the code to see what happens!
